# nyt-flickr-search-test
Simple test application using New York Times / Flickr REST API and json.

* How it works
  - Using 5 keywords that were extracted from the NYT articles' abstract (which are the longest words in each article), it searches 20 photos for each keyword (total 100 photos) in Flickr.
  - It uses New York Times ArticleSearch API to search and get information about articles. It also uses Flickr API to search and get the data about the photo. 

(Got idea from project assignment of SI506 in Umich)
